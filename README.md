## Halloween-Spartan Themed Action Sudoku
This is a new version of the notorious Sudoku puzzle, which provides users with more engagement and interactivity. Inspired by the Halloween month and my school's mascot Spartan, users will role-play as a Spartan, moving around a spooky world, eating ghost numbers and spitting it to the right place to complete the game. The next levels may involve some other features, such as headbutting or floating-around digits.

## Description
### How to play
You move around the playground by clicking where you want your Spartan to move to. Then to eat the numbers, press Space. There is an Xray at the bottom left of the playground, which indicates the Spartan stomach with limited capacity. The digits you eat will go to the Xray, but you cannot eat more than the capacity of Spartan's stomach. To actually spitting out the digits and complete the game, move to one of the cell in the Sudoku board and press the number you wanna spit. Spartan will do that as long as it has that number in his stomach. 
If you find it difficult to solve, choose File -> Solve. It will auto-complete the game and move you to the next level.
### Levels
There are 3 levels in total.
#### Level 0
This is just a brief introduction to the game and act as an tutorial.
#### Level 1
This looks exactly like what is covered in [How to play](#how-to-play) section. You just move around eating and spitting digits.
#### Level 2
Same as level 1 with the addition of headbutting. There will be some numbers in cauldrons that Spartan cannot eat directly. It first needs to headbutt them by moving near to the cauldron and pressing B to release the digits; after that, it can eat them as normal.
#### Level 3
Same as level 1 but has another feature: ghost digits - digits that float around freely like ghosts. When the digits are moving, Spartan cannot eat them; it can only eat them standing. To toggle between moving and standing digits, press M.

ðŸŽ‰That's pretty much of everything you need to know! Hope everyone enjoy the game! ðŸŽ‰
